> _The basics about Packet - who we are and what we offer._ 

  

===

### **What is Packet?**

  

Packet was founded in July 2014 with our passion to build a better internet. Our platform brings the price and performance benefits of bare metal servers to the cloud, powering highly-available performance workloads through a unique, never-congested network.

We offer bare metal servers, on demand (seven minutes or less) in our public cloud, hosted in our datacenter. We make this as automated and consistent as using things like AWS. 

With Packet bare metal, there are no noisy neighbors, shared resources, or hypervisors to gum up the works and impact your workload. Your dedicated servers are 100%, well... Yours!

While our servers & services are completely unmanaged. If you experience issues with your server you can reach out to our support team via [email](mailto:support@packet.com), [Slack](https://slack.packet.com/).

### **Is Packet bare metal designed for high availability?**

  

Yes! We deploy our Portals, website, API and associated micro-services in an HA environment, so we have thought a lot about how to make Packet a great platform for highly available application deployments.

All our servers have dual, bonded network interfaces, which are cabled to different top of rack switches, which in turn connect to redundant core routers. Basically, 2N redundant at the server, rack, and facility level.

Another thing that sets us apart from other colocation or dedicated service providers is our metadata service. It allows you to define User Data for Cloud-init, which paves the way for service discovery, application installation, or whatever else you need for bootstrapping a node into a cluster.

### **Does Packet offer an “on premise” solution?**

  

We built our hardware automation technology so that it could be shipped anywhere. For now that's mainly in our four public cloud data centers, but we also do a lot of private deployments in our facilities as well.  

Although we do not currently automate legacy gear, for certain large scale users we will deliver our automation in an "on premise" environment.  If you are looking at a greenfield deployment we would love to [talk with you](mailto:support@packet.com)!

### Does Packet own its Data centers?

  

While Packet is a leading force in the cloud market, we are not a real estate development firm.  As such, we lease large amounts of space and power from colocation providers ([read about our selection process and grab our RFP template](https://www.packet.com/blog/how-to-select-and-bid-your-next-datacenter/)). 

###   
**What kind of certifications does Packet have?**

  

Packet does not offer PCI compliant hosting and rarely sign BAAs, we are deeply committed to security best-practices.  As such, a lot of our customers want to know about the certification status of each of our facilities.    
  

We rent large amounts of colocation space from Tier 1 providers like Equinix and Interxion ([read more about our process here](https://www.packet.com/blog/how-to-select-and-bid-your-next-datacenter/)), and each of our data centers have been certified to national and/or international security standards.
