# The Locations

While Packet is a leading force in the cloud market, we are not a real estate development firm.  As such, we lease large amounts of space and power from colocation providers \([read about our selection process and grab our RFP template](https://www.packet.com/blog/how-to-select-and-bid-your-next-datacenter/)\). 

Packet does not offer PCI compliant hosting and rarely sign BAAs, we are deeply committed to security best-practices.  As such, a lot of our customers want to know about the certification status of each of our facilities.   

## **What's the difference between "Core" and "Edge"?**

Packet has two types of facilities: Core and Edge. All [locations](https://www.packet.com/locations/) feature our entire software / automation platform and network topology. Everything that you can do from an automation and networking perspective is the same across all locations.

The only difference is inventory. In our edge locations we stock a more limited number of configurations \(currently a single "[x1.small.x86](https://www.packet.com/cloud/servers/x1-small/)"\), and we don't have block storage at the edge sites.

_Note: all sites are available for_ [_Private Deployments_](https://www.packet.com/custom/private-deployment/)_, which allow you to customize configurations in private racks on a commitment._
