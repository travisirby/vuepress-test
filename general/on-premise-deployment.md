# On Premise Deployment

## **Does Packet offer an “on premise” solution?**

We built our hardware automation technology so that it could be shipped anywhere. For now that's mainly in our four public cloud data centers, but we also do a lot of private deployments in our facilities as well.  

Although we do not currently automate legacy gear, for certain large scale users we will deliver our automation in an "on premise" environment.  If you are looking at a greenfield deployment we would love to [talk with you](mailto:support@packet.com)!
